# ML_Security_Lab3

 In this HW I designed a backdoor detector for BadNets trained on the YouTube Face dataset using the pruning defense discussed in
class(ECE-9163).My detector took as input:
    1. B, a backdoored neural network classifier with N classes.
    2. Dvalid, a validation dataset of clean, labelled images.
## Dataset
1. The validation and test datasets needs to be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13o2ybRJ1BkGUvfmQEeZqDo1kskyFywab?usp=sharing) before running the code.
2. The dataset contains images from YouTube Aligned Face Dataset. 
## Repaired networks for X={2%,4%,10%,30%}. 
Repaired networks for X={2%,4%,10%,30%} are put in the Model folder.
